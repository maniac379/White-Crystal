Disassembly Notes
------------------
To add triggers to a map that did not already have some, you'd need to:
(1) Add the map to engine/map_triggers.asm
(2) Give it a new trigger byte in the "Map Triggers" section of wram.asm 
	The "ds 49" declares enough free space for 49 more


ASM/Binary Functions
---------------------
Arithmetic operators on binary numbers: +, -, * or ×, / or ÷
Binary operators: &, |, ^, <<, and >>

0 is false and 1 is true

& means "and"
	Naturally, if both values are true (first and second) then the result is true; otherwise it's false. 
	So: 0 & 0 = 0; 0 & 1 = 0; 1 & 0 = 0; 1 & 1 = 1.
| means "or"
	Again, just like with the English word "or", if either value is true (first or second) then the result is true; otherwise it's false. 
	So: 0 | 0 = 0; 0 | 1 = 1; 1 | 0 = 1; 1 | 1 = 1.
^ means "xor" aka "exclusive or"
	This is like "either/or" in English: you can have ice cream in a bowl xor a cup but not both (whereas you can have vanilla or chocolate, i.e. you can have some of both). 
	You can also treat it as ?, since it's true if the values are not equal. 
	So: 0 ^ 0 = 0; 0 ^ 1 = 1; 1 ^ 0 = 1; 1 ^ 1 = 0.
<< and >> mean "shift"
	Imagine a byte as a string of bits; so 15010 (decimal) = $96 (hex) = %10010110 (binary). Shifting moves the bits left or right, filling in the blanks with 0s. For example, %101 << 3 = %101000, that is, 5 << 3 = 40. And %1001 >> 2 = %10, that is, 9 >> 2 = 2.
	(Actually, logical shift operations fill in the blanks with 0s. Arithmetic shift is different when you're shifting right: since two's complement notation treats the leftmost bit as a sign indicator, the byte %10010110 represents -106, not 150. %10010110 >> 1 with logical shift would be %01001011, which is definitely 75. But %10010110 >> 1 with arithmetic shift would be %10001011, which is -117 in two's complement. I'm just mentioning this for completeness, since your shiny code is using left shift.)
You'll notice that the assembly instructions and, or, xor, sla, sra, and srl are just those binary operations with register a as both the first value and the result. 
	So "xor b" calculates a ^ b and stores the result in a. Or, "and 1 << SHINY_ATK_BIT" calculates a & (1 << SHINY_ATK_BIT) and stores the result in a. (SHINY_ATK_BIT is 5, so 1 << SHINY_ATK_BIT is 1 << 5, which is 32—or more clearly, %100000, a 1 with five zeros.)

Consider "and"ing some value %abcdefgh with %11110000:
	abcdefgh
      &	11110000
	————————
   	abcd0000

For a single bit q, no matter whether it's 0 or 1, q & 0 = 0. 
	So the lower four digits become 0. 
	Furthermore, for the upper four being "and"ed with 1, 0 & 1 = 0 and 1 & 1 = 1, so simply q & 1 = q, and the upper four stay the same.
	(Just as "and" can selectively make bits 0, "or" can selectively make bits 1. Try "or"ing some arbitrary values with, say, %00110000 and see what it does.)
